Description: This package contains simple, user-friendly functions to easily 
    clean any RSA-911 dataset. It is assumed the inputed RSA-911 dataset has
    variables named using appropriate RSA-911 conventions. The main function,
    detox, cleans the dataset in one step, which includes converting variables
    to appropriate types, tailored NA imputation, and reorganization of certain
    variables. The resulting cleaned dataset is prepared for analysis and 
    plotting.
